Welcome to "Nikki and the Robots"

http://joyridelabs.de/


This is a 2D-Platformer. The program consists of two parts: The game and a
level editor.

1. The game

We tried to make the controls of the game intuitive. Remember: In the game you
can use the arrow keys and two other buttons: Ctrl and Shift. So we hope you
will be able to figure it all out. But here are the controls anyway:

Nikki controls:
arrow keys - move around
Ctrl - jump
Shift - Use a terminal.

Terminal controls:
arrow keys - select robot (or eject)
Ctrl - confirm choice

Robot controls:
Well, that depends on the robot.
Try the arrow keys and Ctrl.
Shift always brings you back to the terminal.

2. The level editor

The level editor has its own help. You can find it in the editor menu.
