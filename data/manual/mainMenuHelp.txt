CONTROLS

We are trying to make the controls of the game as intuitive as possible. So, we hope you will be able to figure it out by yourselves for the most part.

The keys that are used for playing are the ARROW KEYS, CTRL, SHIFT and ESC.

Nikki's Controls:
ARROW KEYS - move left and right
CTRL - jump
SHIFT - use a terminal

Terminal Menu Controls:
ARROW KEYS - select a robot (or eject)
CTRL - confirm your choice

Robot Controls:
ARROW KEYS - depending on the robot
CTRL - depending on the robot
SHIFT - will bring up the terminal menu again

General Game Menu Controls:
ARROW KEYS - move cursor
CTRL - confirm
SHIFT or ESC - go back

Further, ESC will let you quit a level at anytime.

There is also an additional help for the more complex level editor. You can find it in the menu of the editor.
