Welcome to "Nikki and the Robots"

http://joyridelabs.de/


This is a 2D-Platformer. The program consists of two parts: The game and a
level editor.

1. The game

We tried to make the controls of the game intuitive. So we hope you will be
able to figure it all out by yourselves. One thing you need to now: While in
the game you can use the arrow keys and two buttons: Ctrl and Shift. Escape
will end the level.

But here are the controls anyway:

Nikki Controls:
arrow keys - move around
Ctrl - jump
Shift - Use a terminal.

Terminal Menu Controls:
arrow keys - select robot (or eject)
Ctrl - confirm choice

Robot Controls:
Well, that depends on the robot.
Try the arrow keys and Ctrl.
Shift always brings you back to the terminal menu.

The objective in each level is to switch on all the switches you can find.

2. The level editor

The level editor has its own help. You can find it in the editor menu.
