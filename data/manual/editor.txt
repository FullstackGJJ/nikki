These are the keyboard shortcuts for the editor (advanced mode):

General
=======

Escape - bring up the menu

Editing Mode
============

Arrow keys - move the cursor
CTRL - set an object
Shift - delete an object
a and d - select another object
w and s - change the cursor step size
b - send object under cursor to the back of the layer
+ and - - select active layer
space - activate selection mode
v - paste selected objects
t - test the level in game mode
h - test the level in game mode with Nikki at cursor position

As the objective in every level is to switch on all the switches, you should place
at least one switch in your level. Also don't forget to put Nikki in it.

Selection Mode
==============

Arrow keys - move the upper right corner of the selection box
x - cut selected objects
c - copy selected objects
B button or Shift - delete objects in selection (without changing clipboard contents)
w and s - change the cursor step size

Object Edit Mode
================

Some objects allow you to edit special attributes. To do that, select the
object by placing the cursor above it (correct selection of an object will be
indicated in the lower right corner) and go to the menu and select
"edit object". What you can configure depends on the object you're editing. At
the moment you can edit:
 - Terminals
    Configure which robots will be accessible via the terminal
 - Moving Platforms
    Configure the path of the platform.
