Nikki and the Robots is a 2D platformer written in Haskell and produced by Joyride Laboratories. Nikki, the protagonist,
walks and jumps around the levels wearing a cute ninja/cat costume. Nikki refrains from using any tools or weapons, with
one exception: The Robots. These come in various types with different abilities and can be used by Nikki to solve puzzles,
overcome obstacles and complete the level tasks. The game will feature an integrated level editor.

Publishing
==========

We are releasing the game and the level editor under an open source license (LGPL). The included graphics are published
under a permissive Creative Commons license (cc-by-sa). We're also planning to create a server that will allow
players to upload the levels they created and download levels from other players. We hope that a community of coders,
level creators and players will emerge around the game.

Simultaneously, we are working on episodes that we plan to sell via the game. These will include new graphics, more
robots, a story line, other characters and other surprises.

(Just to clarify: The licensing is very permissive. It allows others to create their own episodes and distribute them
freely or sell them. This would be very welcome. If anybody is interested in this, we propose to join forces and sell all
our episodes through one system.)

Used Technologies
=================

- Qt for user input and rendering
- OpenGL as an efficient rendering backend for Qt. Everything will remain 2D, though - we promise!
- Hipmunk, the Haskell bindings to the chipmunk physics engine

Getting involved
================

The project is still in alpha stage, so there are some features that aren't yet implemented. For some, we have a clear
vision on how to implement them; for others, we don't. If you want to get involved, check out our darcs repo, our
launchpad site and don't hesitate to contact us.
