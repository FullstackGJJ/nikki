This directory contains all source file for Nikki and the Robots.
External dependencies are:

* csfml
* qt
* lots of haskell stuff from hackage

There is a custom build script: build.hs. It needs imports from buildSystem and common.
For example, do this:

ghc -ibuildSystem -icommon --make build.hs
./build.hs build_application
