This directory contains all source files for Nikki and the Robots.

1. Available scripts
====================

./linuxCompile.sh and ./windowsCompile.sh
Compiles everything in place.

./clean.sh
Removes all compilation products.

./linuxRunInPlace.sh
Runs the game in place. Run ./linuxCompile.sh first.

./windowsDeploy.sh
Creates a distributable application on windows. 
(Compiling on windows is very complicated right now. We are using msys and mingw to do this. The main problem is, that both Qt and the GHC come with their own gcc version. We managed to get the ghc use Qt's gcc, but it seems not very elegant. If you have experience in compiling stuff on windows and have some time to help out, you effort would be highly appreciated.)

./haddock.sh
Builds the Haskell code documentation. Run ./compile.sh first.

./testsuite
Contains a testsuite (which covers only very selected parts of the code).

./scripts
Contains helper scripts.


2. External dependencies
========================

* cmake (tested with 2.8.0)

* qt (tested with 4.6.2 and 4.7.0 beta)

* ghc (tested with 6.10 and 6.12)

* cabal-install (tested with 0.8.2)
    http://haskell.org/cabal/download.html

* csfml (and sfml)
    Tested with the svn version (of sfml 2)
    get it: svn co https://sfml.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sfml/trunk sfml2-svn
    how to compile it: http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/1.6/start-linux.php
    Do something like:
        make
        sudo make install
        cd CSFML
        make
        sudo make install
    Don't forget to install sfml before trying to build csfml.

* homegrown haskell bindings for sfml-audio
    install with e.g.:
        darcs get http://darcs.joyridelabs.de/sfml-audio/
        cd sfml-audio
        cabal install

* hipmunk-5.2.0.2 from http://darcs.joyridelabs.de/Hipmunk-5.2.0.2.tar.gz
    install with e.g.:
        wget http://darcs.joyridelabs.de/Hipmunk-5.2.0.2.tar.gz
        tar xf Hipmunk-5.2.0.2.tar.gz
        cd Hipmunk-5.2.0.2
        cabal install

* lots of haskell stuff from hackage
    look at nikki.cabal for full hackage dependencies
